# Animal-Trading-Card :flamingo:
<p>As part of Udacity's Web Developer Nanodegree program, I took on a super fun project that tasked me with 
creating an animal trading card from scratch, using nothing but HTML and CSS. I breezed through this project
with lightning speed and had a blast putting my design skills to the test.</p>
